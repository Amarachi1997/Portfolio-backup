                        Idea block - Confusion - Imposter Syndrome– zero motivation- The lineage of demons that creeps up on nearly all new developers at their edge of breakthrough. 
                    </strong>
                </h5>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    At least 7 in 10 newbies are faced with this problem especially if they were lucky to get a job very early in their careers. Even senior devs are not left out as they may get hit when faced with an extremely unfamiliar cross.
                </p>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    At its early stages, new devs may begin to question whether or not they were as good as they thought all this while. This would then give the never-sort consolation- Imposter Syndrome, a high seat in their minds.
                </p>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    Why should imposter syndrome get all of this attention many may ask? Well, maybe it is because this demon has dropped to an irreversible extent, the esteem of many brilliant developers and also turned many prospective badasses, away from the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rollback- “imposter syndrome is a feeling or belief that you are not as competent as you thought you were”
                </p>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    At least, 60% of the time, it starts with meager problems such as a missing semicolon you can’t trace, a mismatched spelling of a variable or in the most popular case, the inability to ask the internet the right questions.

                </p>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    Regardless, it is a very destructive belief and one must learn to take charge once it hits. So first, before making any move, one of these decisions must be made- To Feed this feeling or to phase it..

                    How To Know You Are Feeding Your Imposter Syndrome
                </h3>
                <p spellcheck="true">
                    Feeding imposter syndrome is uncontrollably the most sought option. In fact, one must have fed it to proper nutrition before beginning to rid themselves of it.
                   <br> Lets see how it is fed:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The constant belief  that you have not done enough and every progress made since the journey started is termed - child’s play.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The online success of others becomes the yardstick used to measure your unique and divine progress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inability to successfully execute a project after clearly following a tutorial on how to do it, makes you conclude that this career path isn’t for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A natural mistake turns into self defamation

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All of the above then causes the loss of motivation because now there is this belief that no amount of effort would make a difference
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But wait; “you know the difference between you and who you see as the best developer is EXPERIENCE and experience depends on TIME”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is something New developers should take important note of because not only are they trying to learn a new language or tool, they are yet to master the workings process which can only be gained through experience. 
                </p>
                <p spellcheck="true">This means, whether or not you learn the whole of JavaScript in a week, you still need some time to actually master the craft.</p>
                <h3>How To Make a Phase of Imposter Syndrome</h3>
                <p>
                    To make a phase of your imposter syndrome is to literally make it a phase and the reason they are called phases is because they PASS. There is no direct medication to immediately chase it out, but there are mental exercises per say that could be carried out to help ensure that this demon is really just a PHASE:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>“No One Is Perfect” is not just a quote: </strong>
                        Truly understanding that No one is perfect is probably the first mental absorption that should take place. Senior developers still make mistakes and get cursed out sometimes by the boss. This shows that It is nearly impossible to write perfect code at the first so, start now to cut yourself some slack (but not too much slack).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Get used to getting stuck:</strong>
                        Getting stuck while writing code is just as normal as eating when you are hungry. In fact, if you don't get stuck at some point…. naa you will definitely get stuck no matter what. Just constantly remind yourself that the stuck phase is the shortest phase.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>“You are not Dumb” and thats on Period:</strong>
                        Start now to say "NO" to those thoughts. Especially those ones that make you feel like you ain't shit. Take it from someone who has had lots of 'one-week-stands' with nearly all programming languages there is, saying no to those thoughts is the first big step in overcoming those hurdles and staying faithful to code.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Discipline your courage:</strong>
                        This sounds weird even me writing thinks it's weird but this is very important. I always had the courage to start learning a new language but I lacked the discipline to stay when it got hard. This made me run away from about 5 languages when I got to ‘loops and switch statements’. It was at this point I realised I had to discipline those wits because there actually is a thing called “courageous failures” So, suck it up and crack those loops and switch statements in your life.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Be Grateful for the bits of new knowledge:</strong>
                        Being grateful for little they say gives way for more. Well, the same goes for knowledge. Learning how to declare a variable is knowledge like it or not and you deserve a pat on the back if you learn that in a day. Eventually, looking back a month, you must have come really far with the amount of new knowledge accumulated everyday. Now, those down moments, think of how far you have come. It should help you keep in check or even up your self-esteem.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Take Some Time Off:</strong>
                        Take as much time as you need. Do other stuff, binge watch a series on Netflix or read a book if you want. Do whatever it is that takes your mind off it. It might be in those off moments that the solutions creep in and you go "Eureka!"
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Beg If You Have To</strong>
                        Being timid to a point of being unable to ask for what you need is “rubbish” Take it from the longest serving shy queen. You might be scared of writing out your problem on Stack Overflow but you just have to. If you fail at it, you would feel worse so why hold back. Go on and ask every question there is. Make use of the abundance of people online and offline who would go any length to get you solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The bottom line is if you succumb to imposter syndrome, you lose at everything. You lose your job eventually, you lose yourself because it makes you think your growth is useless and when that is lost, there’s really nothing left of you. Eventually, you die a stuck up person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is just how I feel 😊
                </p>
